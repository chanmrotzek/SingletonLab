# SingletonLab
heyo it's a lab i guess
following the steps laid out in the lab, i got the same hash code returned from all 3 threads. 
from these results, i assume that there's truly only one instance of the singleton, as if there were different instances, i'd expect different hash codes.

neat stuff!
